# Expense-tracker

![Expense tracker image](./expense-tracker.png)

A simple expense tracker in **vanilla JavaScript**

Data is persisted in `localStorage`, and reactivity is handled using native browser APIs and HTML templates.

The use of HTML templates provides a great alternative to innerHTML, as it is less susceptible to xss attacks!
